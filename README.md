# Suggestotron

This is my first Ruby on Rails app, and it was inspired by the Seattle RailsBridge [Intro to Rails workshop](http://railsbridge.nird.us/intro-to-rails/). It runs with Ruby 1.9.3 and Rails 4.0.2.

The Suggestotron lets people up vote items in a list. After following the directions in the tutorial, I figured out how to add a "-1" button, sort the list by vote order, and remove the "-1" button when the votes were 0, so that the vote count would not go below 0.
